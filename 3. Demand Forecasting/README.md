# Demand Forecasting Project

## Overview
This folder explores various approaches to demand forecasting by leveraging time series data. It focuses on preprocessing sales data, building multiple forecasting models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the results.

## Notebook Outline
- **1. Data Preprocessing**
  - Load and prepare sales data for analysis.
  - Filter relevant sub-categories and aggregate weekly totals.
  - Visualize time series trends for preliminary insights.
  
- **2. Model Development**
  - Build forecasting models using statistical and machine learning approaches:
    - **ARIMA/SARIMA Models**
    - **Exponential Smoothing Methods**
    - **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Machines.
    
- **3. Model Evaluation**
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **4. Forecast Visualization**
  - Visualize forecasts and perform residual analysis to assess model accuracy and reliability.

## Key Highlights
- Emphasis on combining statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Comprehensive visualization for time series and residual diagnostics.
- Modular and reusable Python code for demand forecasting tasks.
