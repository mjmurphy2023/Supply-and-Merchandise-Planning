# Supply-and-Merchandise-Planning
End-to-end supply and merchandise planning project for a hiking and equipment retailer. Includes synthetic data generation, SQL database management, demand forecasting, and "What-If" simulations to analyze impacts of demand changes, equipment failure, and labor shortages on inventory and resource utilization. 

Below is an overview of what is contained in each Folder of the Project

## Synthetic Data Creation

This folder contains synthetic data created for a supply and merchandise planning project for a hiking apparel and equipment retail company. The data includes tables with essential information on inventory, sales, production, and other key supply chain metrics, designed to enable comprehensive analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## SQL Setup and Analysis

This folder contains a SQL notebook that demonstrates how to set up a SQLite database from CSV files and perform data analysis for a retail hiking and equipment company. The notebook includes importing data, database creation, and executing SQL queries to generate actionable business insights. 

## Demand Forecasting

This folder explores various approaches to demand forecasting by leveraging time series data. It focuses on preprocessing sales data, building multiple forecasting models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the results. 

## What If Scenario Simulation

This folder contains a simulation notebook for modeling and analyzing production processes of a retail hiking apparel and equipment company. The goal is to optimize production scheduling, assess resource utilization, and evaluate scenario impacts on KPIs such as on-time delivery, machine utilization, and labor utilization.
